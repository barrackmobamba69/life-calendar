# life-calendar

Life Calendar is a visually appealing web application that presents your life in weeks, offering a unique perspective on the passage of time and the finite nature of our lives.

## Features

- Input your birthdate and expected lifespan
- Visualize your life as a grid of weeks
- Highlight passed weeks and your current week
- Age markers for every decade
- Responsive design with a stylish color scheme
- Social media icons for easy sharing and connection

## How It Works

The Life Calendar application uses JavaScript to calculate and display a grid representing the weeks of your life. Each small box represents one week, and the rows represent years. The application color-codes the weeks to show:

- Passed weeks (filled with orange)
- Current week (highlighted with a glowing animation)
- Future weeks (light gray)

## Design and Styling

## Customization

You can customize the appearance of the calendar by modifying the `style.css` file. Key areas for customization include:

- Color scheme (body, weeks, buttons)
- Font styles and sizes
- Layout adjustments (grid size, spacing)

The JavaScript logic can be found in the `script.js` file if you want to adjust the calculation or display logic.
